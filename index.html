                    <h2>What is this?</h2>

                    <p>I started building websites for fun when I was around ten or so years old because the internet was new and weird at the time and so was I, I guess.</p>
        
                    <p>This site was created in November 2022 as an experiment and creative outlet. It has changed a lot over the years.</p>
        
                    <p>More recently I found a bunch of retro-style websites reminiscent of the 90s and wanted my creative outlet back.</p>
        
                    <p>This website is coded with love and mild frustration by Yours Truly using Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I make the graphics using Paint Shop Pro 7 and Gimp. The site is viewable on a mobile device but is best viewed on a larger screen of some kind, I guess a PC or whatever.</p>

                    <p>I worked at a beer bar for a good chunk of my life when I was a post-college, directionless young person. I look back fondly on those years, mainly because of the people I met and the things I learned, but also because I developed
                        a taste for craft beer. Here I will try to remember and describe some of my favorites.</p>

                        <li>Cavatelli (pronounced gava-DEEL for effect) or any short pasta</li>

                    <br>Boil or saute&#769; the broccoli
                    <br>Throw the cooked broccoli and pasta into a large pot with all your olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic. Cook for a while, add seasoning and olive oil as needed. It's done when it's hot and seasoned to your liking.

            Easy enough. I used broccoli and other veggies instead of chicken. I think I would like it spicier. </li>

                    I've made this twice now and it is becoming a favorite! Pretty straightforward and delicious. Easy to modify depending on what vegetables I have around. I added rutabaga to the cauliflower this time (January 2025). </li>

            This was an interesting adventure marked by working with a friend, not fully understanding how to zest a blood orange, not having enough heavy cream so using some oat milk, not knowing if freezing heavy cream makes it split (it does), and not knowing if we'd cooked the cream slowly enough (we hadn't). </li>

                <br>An Italian classic! I somehow used too much pasta. Very good with parmesan cheese and a big ol' French table loaf.

                <br>You know how some recipes are not written very well and are difficult to follow? This was not one of those. The instructions were quite clear. 10/10 on recipe-writing. I subbed Halloumi cheese for shrimp; it had a stronger flavor than I expected but overall the dish was good.

      <li><details><summary>The veggie sandwich they used to make at the restaurant I used to work at.</summary>
        This one has a story. When I worked in a restaurant they made this delicious veggie sandwich that I ordered all the time. Then they stopped making it. I was sad, but my friend working in the kitchen said, "Briana, you know the ingredients. You can make the sandwich yourself." "But it won't be the same!" I protested. Fast-forward to many years later, when I finally decided to try making this sandwich myself. It absolutely was not the same. The ingredients are:
            <ul>
                <li>hummus</li>
                <li>feta cheese</li>
                <li>kalamata olives</li>
                <li>roasted red peppers</li>
                <li>tomatoes</li>
                <li>mixed greens</li>
                <li>focaccia</li>
            </ul>
        My theories on why it's not the same when I make it:
            <ul>
                <li>I can never find good focaccia at the store.</li>
                <li>The hummus at the restaurant was made in the restaurant. I will never be able to buy or make that exact hummus.</li>
                <li>Typically when I used to order the sandwich I would order it with a side of fries, and the fries at this place were delicious. I will never be able to replicate those fries.</li>
            </ul>
        So that is my sandwich story.

            <ul>

                <li>I have learned from cooking never to buy pine nuts. Pine nuts are typically included in recipes as like a last-minute add-on for some extra flavor or something. I have to admit, I like their flavor. But I don't like spending stupid money on them only to use like 26 of them and then have about 8,200 left in the package that I will never use. Or I start eating them until I feel sick.</li>

                <li>Drinking a glass of wine and cooking a meal might be my favorite combination of activities.
                </li>

                <li>I often like to eat foods that are not traditionally considered breakfast foods for breakfast, like pasta.
                </li>

                <li>When I moved from New Jersey to Pennsylvania I was teased for pronouncing 'coffee' like 'kaw-fee' and so I toned it down. I still pronounce 'chocolate' like 'chaw-klet' and refuse to change.
                </li>

                <li>I clean while I cook.</li>

                <li>I hate baking but about once a year I forget how much I hate it, and then I am reminded again the minute I get swept away in a cookie recipe and find my floor covered in flour.</li>

        <p>So... I don't remember where I found this book but I think it was in one of those little free libraries or in a box on the sidewalk. Regardless, the book is incredibly old and is one of 1,050 copies printed (according to a statement on the inside cover). Some research revealed that this book is volume 5 of an 8-volume set, and is somewhat valuable if you have the entire set in good condition. Mine is not a full set and is in very bad condition.</p>

        Marion Gibson        
    <p>So far this book has been a pleasant surprise. I borrowed it from the library wanting to learn how to be a witch or something, but instead am receiving stories about witch hunts and how they are comparable to modern-day 'witch hunts' (think the Communism McCarthy trials and things like that). Basically witch hunts are used by powerful people to dehumanize others so they can stay in power, and they continue to this day.</p>

                So much fun! I think I imagined this would be tedious and weird because of its age, but how ageist of me.

                <summary>Just Ignore Him</summary> by Alan Davies<br>
                Interesting look into the childhood of a comedian I admire. I discovered Alan Davies while watching cable TV in London and warming up to shows like QI and Taskmaster. Friend2 and I have particularly fond memories of getting back to our flat at night--arms loaded with unfamiliar snacks from the grocery store down the street--and popping on the telly to wind down and absorb some culture. I somehow found out that Davies had a painful childhood and, being always attracted to sad comedians because I somehow relate to their desperate need for everyone to like them, I decided to read his memoir. I remember it being very sad and sometimes amusing.

                History is not my strong suit but this was a really interesting look at the problematic relations between colonists and Native Americans. Completely different justice systems, all kinds of bias, corruption, etc. Very eye-opening. I didn't think I could hate colonialism more but here we are.

                <summary>A Christmas Carol</summary> by Charles Dickens<br>
                Another surprise joy from what I expected to be a dusty old classic. I'd had a bad experience with Dickens after trying to read <em>Great Expectations</em> in high school with an English teacher who I despised. This was a much more pleasant experience and proves why it is such a classic.

                <li>My family had a shore house when I was a kid and I still vividly remember the sound of the seagulls and the way it felt to walk in the crab grass in our backyard. The sun is also extremely bright in these memories.</li>

                <li>My friends and I traveled to Montreal in June 2024 and I've officially been converted from someone who didn't understand the hype around poutine to someone who cannot stop thinking about the delicious mushroom poutine I had from a food truck.

                <li>Haste makes paste. [my mom]</li>
                <li>Razors pain you; Rivers are damp; Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Guns aren't lawful; Nooses give; Gas smells awful; You might as well live. [Dorothy Parker (1893-1967)]</li>

                <p><em><a href="https://museariadne.neocities.org/" target="_blank">muse ariadne</a> prompt week of mar 3rd: write about something you wonder if others do, too</em></p>
                <p>Honestly I am not in a good creative mode right now, and I wonder if others also straight up tell themselves when they're not feeling creative. Or, I guess I wonder how consistently creative people handle their moments of non-creativity. I am a regimented person, usually, so I enjoy routine, and I recently told myself I would do one creative thing per day. It can be anything really: writing, drawing, maybe even cooking could count. Even if I just draw one line in my notebook, it counts as long as I am taking that moment to attempt to feel creative. So I'm pretty much forcing this one out of myself right now. I'm not even really following the prompt now. I just wanted to get something out for today, and I wonder if others do this. My logic is that staying in the daily habit of doing something like this will eventually lead to a day of free-flowing creativity! Whoop-dee-doo!

                <p>My flesh is hard and scratchy this time of year. My bones? Probably fine. The muscles may bristle at the cold sometimes, but my bones are in there keeping things together. If only I could breathe in deep with every breath and provide my
                    blood the necessary oxygen. But let's be realistic: sometimes we forget to really breathe.

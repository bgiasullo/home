                <p>I started building websites for fun when I was around ten or so years old because the internet was new and weird at the time and so was I, I guess.</p>

                <p>This site was created in November 2022 as an experiment and creative outlet. It has changed a lot over the years.</p>

                <p>More recently I found a bunch of retro-style websites reminiscent of the 90s and wanted my creative outlet back.</p>

                <p>This website is coded with love and mild frustration by Yours Truly using Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I make the graphics using Paint Shop Pro 7 and Gimp. The site is viewable on a mobile device but is best viewed on a larger screen of some kind, I guess a PC or whatever.</p>

            <p>I worked at a beer bar for a good chunk of my life when I was a post-college, directionless young person. I look back fondly on those years, mainly because of the people I met and the things I learned, but also because I developed
                        a taste for craft beer. Here I will try to remember and describe some of my favorites.</p>

                    <p>I also have some interesting attempts at making beer-related pixel art. Enjoy my amateur creations!</p>

                            <p>Kazak is a dog who appears in Kurt Vonnegut's <em>The Sirens of Titan</em> and <em>Breakfast of Champions</em>, probably as a different dog each time. There is also Kazakh the dog who appears in <em> GalÃ¡pagos</em> and is also
                                apparently a different dog, though I kind of thought of them all as the same dog in different universes.</p>

                            <summary><em>Hallowe'en Party</em> by Agatha Christie</summary>
                            <p>So much fun! I think I imagined this would be tedious and weird because of its age, but how ageist of me. Supposedly this is not even one of Christie's best works but I adored it nonetheless and want to read more of hers. Honestly
                                just so fun and funny! Nevermind that actually solving the mystery myself was probably impossible.</p>

                            <summary><em>Just Ignore Him</em> by Alan Davies</summary>
                            <p>Interesting look into the childhood of a comedian I admire. I discovered Alan Davies while watching cable TV in London and warming up to shows like QI and Taskmaster. Friend2 and I have particularly fond memories of getting back
                                to our flat at night--arms loaded with unfamiliar snacks from the grocery store down the street--and popping on the telly to wind down and absorb some culture. I somehow found out that Davies had a painful childhood and,
                                being always attracted to sad comedians because I somehow relate to their desperate need for everyone to like them, I decided to read his memoir. I remember it being very sad and sometimes amusing.</p>

                            <summary><em>Lock In</em> by John Scalzi</summary>
                            <p>I don't remember finishing this book because I hated it so much. Just not my style, I guess. The author tried very hard to sound snarky and it wasn't landing for me.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary><em>Kiki's Delivery Service</em> by Eiko Kadono</summary>
                            <p>Perfect, sweet, absolute gem of a book! I can't say enough how much I adored this little tale. I literally wanted to become a witch when I read this and within days watched the movie.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary><em>Tortilla Flat</em> by John Steinbeck</summary>
                            <p>Standard sad Steinbeck. But the imagery of the California countryside sticks with me, and the fact that I felt sorry for the main characters despite their flaws.</p>

                        <details>
                            <summary><em>Covered with Night</em> by Nicole Eustace</summary>
                            <p>History is not my strong suit but this was a really interesting look at the problematic relations between colonists and Native Americans. Completely different justice systems, all kinds of bias, corruption, etc. Very eye-opening.
                                I didn't think I could hate colonialism more but here we are.</p>

                            <summary><em>A Christmas Carol</em> by Charles Dickens</summary>
                            <p>Another surprise joy from what I expected to be a dusty old classic. I'd had a bad experience with Dickens after trying to read <em>Great Expectations</em> in high school with an English teacher who I despised. This was a much
                                more pleasant experience and proves why it is such a classic.</p>

                        <p>My flesh is hard and scratchy this time of year. My bones? Probably fine. The muscles may bristle at the cold sometimes, but my bones are in there keeping things together. If only I could breathe in deep with every breath and provide my blood the necessary oxygen. But let's be realistic: sometimes we forget to really breathe.

                        <p>You will be bored on many days, in many situations.<br>
                            It won't be that bad, though, so long as you don't allow it to be.<br>

                        <p>10/2 - 10/3</p>

                            Japan October 2024<br>
                            Giant mimosas before the flight<br>
                            Tons of food on plane<br>
                            Good but ice cream is not considered vegetarian. Friend1 and I sad.<br>
                            Woman behind us talking about feeling sick from eating Reuben sandwich<br>
                            Longest line through immigration ever<br>
                            Friend2 tried to get in the wrong side of the taxi because driver's side is on the right.<br>
                            First night after finally arriving to hotel consisted of Family Mart fried chicken and beers, 711 egg salad, a rainy first-night walk, then bed for weird TV shows and pillows filled with beads.<br>
                            Oh and the hotel check-in with the robots went smoothly. There are also gochibons in the lobby.
                            
                            <p>10/4</p>
                            
                            <p>Based on corroborated stories, we all woke up early and excited, but we wouldn't know that until we'd all gotten together. So Friend2 and I got out of the hotel around 7 AM for the search for coffee and strawberry cream sandwiches, only finding the former. I wanted to eat light and save myself for the moment of locating that coveted food. We found Friend1 and Friend3 at a Family Mart and walked around a park with shrines. The weather was warm and misty, and I loved it. We got to wash our hands in one of the shrine fountains. We saw what Friend4 and I would later call the liberty bell of Tokyo, deciding to compare landmarks to those of Philly. Have yet to find Rocky steps. Also Friend4 wasn't with us yet because we couldn't get in touch with him due to phone issues and all assumed he was still sleeping. We found him just in time to all go to Tokyo tower together. Turns out he'd also been awake early and wandered around on his own for a bit.</p>
                            
                            <p>At Tokyo tower we ate crepes and rode up to the main deck. The higher level was closed. To make things worse for Friend4, we all collected stamps in our little stamp books which he'd left in his hotel room. He was later able to go back and get them while the rest of us rested.</p>
                            
                            <p>I don't remember much after Tokyo tower. Maybe home to rest then out for lunch. Stressful situation trying to find a place that could accommodate us. Friend2 went home. The four remaining entered a strange downstairs place where the staff spoke no English. Embarrassing situation when I pushed a button on a little machine thing that did not look like it was functional at all but it beeped loudly and a staff person came over immediately. All I could do was apologize profusely. But the machine also would give you a fortune based on your astrological sign if you fed it a coin. Friend1 and I ate fried chicken, for me probably the first time in 20 years. Realizing that Japan is way less vegetarian friendly than I expected.</p>
                            
                            <p>Friend3 home to rest. I was considering same but Friend1 and Friend4 wanted to continue adventuring so I said fuck it and we walked all over creation. I don't remember much other than running for my life to keep up with Friend1 and Friend4 as we ran through busy stations, including Shinjuku, during Friday rush hour to collect stampus. In Shinjuku we walked around and I thought I might die and I led us through the love hotels which were eerily quiet. Finally we found an Irish pub to sit for some beers. Omg I was so tired. We made our way back and Friend2 came out and I said I would just go to the hotel for a minute but I was so dead tired that I fell asleep while the others played darts and marveled at many drunk Japanese business men. Sad I missed out but I was the most tired I've been in my life possibly.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/5</p>
                            
                            Akihabara in the rain<br>
                            McDonald's Coke float not as good as expected<br>
                            my death by gachapans<br>
                            ramen at a ticket ordering place<br>
                            Beginning to learn that everything comes with pork<br>
                            Long travel on bullet train and subways to Osaka<br>
                            Amazing AirBnB<br>
                            Beer vending machine right out front<br>
                            DÅtonbori a bit overwhelming but cool<br>
                            Yakitori was my favorite food so far<br>
                            Friend2 walked us the wrong way for a while so we took a taxi<br>
                            Lights are insane<br>
                            Sooooooo many drunk young people<br>
                            Pole dancing that we viewed through a window from outside where we were sitting with beers and sake. We did not view the pole dance on purpose and everyone else including locals were staring way more than us. Amazing street food being cooked all along what almost is like the Manayunk towpath only like add Times Square or something on top of it.
                            
                            <p>10/6</p>
                        
                            <p>First full day in Osaka. I had a restless sleep with a terrible nightmare. Decided to get up despite being tired because laying in bed alone would make me feel worse.</p>
                            
                            <p>Friend2 and I went to 711 and in my delirium I had a snack buying spree. Really enjoyed the tuna mayo rice triangle (ask Friend2 later for its name) and Friend2 got a German cake that the three of us (Friend4 Friend2 me) shared over breakfast. Friend4 gets kudos for finding the most amazing pancake place that I can't even describe. I am in love with Osaka. The architecture is beautiful, there are small alleys galore with little plants and things I can't describe. More bikes than I've ever seen in my life in a city, usually not even locked up when left. Seriously so many bikes and people zoom around I almost got run over. But Friend4 got us to a tiny alley and somehow we found what didn't look like a cafe until we peaked in and a woman was behind a counter. We went in and confirmed it was the place we were looking for: a tiny cafe where it takes an hour to get pancakes but it is beyond worth the wait. We also had delicious royal milk tea with sugar syrup. I cannot stress enough the enchantment and magic of this place. My god.</p>
                            
                            <p>We wandered around after and found an indoor market thing with all kinds of food that I want. Must go back later. We also found a tiny art gallery tucked behind plants and a little pond thing (very little like everything here. Very little.). And we were almost too afraid to go in until the staff inside beckoned us in. The woman spoke some English and asked where we were from etc. I was proud of my ability to say in Japanese "I don't speak Japanese very well" and she understood and laughed heartily. Friend2 bought an artwork and was so happy. Friend4 got a pin designed by the woman and she asked for a picture with him. We rode that high as we walked home. I bought a million cute gifts at a dollar store. There were so many beautiful sights I can't keep track. I took pics of a beautiful butterfly. It's now 3:32 pm and we are resting up for round two. The AirBnB is perfect except the shower is confusing.</p>
                                                        
                            <p>Okonomoyaki is now my favorite food here. Friend1 and Friend3 arrived to the BnB around 4:35 PM. I hadn't napped as much as I'd liked but I was too excited to stay asleep so got up and welcomed them as best I could. They got situated and I grabbed beers from the vending machine and Friend4 joined us and the four of us sat in the kitchen and caught up on each other's adventures while Friend2 continued napping. Friend3 is feeling better thank god. Didn't mention earlier that he had a tooth issue on the flight and was in pain and staying in the hotel to rest which scared me I thought he would die. We (me Friend2 Friend4) were sad to leave him and Friend1 in Tokyo as we went to Osaka. But thankfully it was probably just jet lag and Friend3 is good to go. I went to wake Friend2 a second time and told him the time was 5 something and he mumbled "A-M?" and I died from laughter. Told him it was P-M and he said "oh yeah" and got up. He later did not remember any of this.</p>
                            
                            <p>So the reunited gang of five sat around in the common space for a bit and then decided we needed to go eat. We did DÅtonbori again and somehow it was more crowded on a Sunday night than the previous Saturday night. But still amazing. Boats galore floating on the river with tourists. Each boat was different and one had a Jack Sparrow impersonator as the tour guide.</p>
                            
                            <p>We split up to get our respective meals. I went up for okonamayaki and was very afraid but feeling more confident after a few days now. I don't know how to describe the situation in front of me but picture a giant flat grill and a man cooking giant omelets galore with people crowded everywhere and I went up to him and attempted to ask "may I?" and he angrily pointed into the building behind him so I walked through there and found the ordering counter. Ordering was painless and I was thankful that the word for beer is simply "bee-ruh" because I needed to ask for them. I was told to wait outside with my ticket so I did but then looked down at my ticket that was covered in Japanese characters and multiple numbers and I knew I was in trouble. I asked a European couple who spoke English if they knew how to read the ticket and they said sorry they did not. I stood next to an angry looking Japanese man who was also holding a ticket, asked him "may I?" as in stand next to him and he nodded so I stood and hoped for the best. Eventually he went up and grabbed his takeaway order and to my great surprise and happiness he came back to me and asked with an accent "can I help you?" and I completely forgot to respond in Japanese because I was so happy but I said OH YESSS PLEEEAASE and he pointed to my ticket and told me I was order number 2 and pointed to where I should stand. I thanked him profusely in Japanese and he left. I stood where I belonged and as if that interaction wasn't enough the previously angry cooking man now smiled largely at me and pointed to a stool for me to sit while I waited. I felt like a princess. I did have to wait a while but I didn't mind because I enjoyed watching them cook and prepare the dishes. I finally got my food and the PACM apologized for the wait and I wished I knew how to say "it's no problem" in Japanese or something similar so I went with "genki" which I think can be celebratory or just mean "I'm fine."</p>
                            
                            <p>We sat along the river and ate our delicious food and had a beer and then walked to Round1 the giant arcade. Crazy hilarious Mario Kart, photo booth, and a DJ game that Friend1 and I were awful at and an employee came over to show us how to not suck so bad. Also some kind of air hockey where like 4,782 pucks get shot out at once. Chaos. Also lots of crane machines with terrible odds. At some point I crashed and needed to get home so we all walked home. I slept much better.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/7</p>
                            
                            <p>The bagels here are soft and chewy just the way I like them.</p>
                            
                            <p>I walked up alone to refill my suica card and had a lovely experience at the train station as my first solo adventure. Walking through this neighborhood is powerful pleasant. I noticed Friend4 nearby at the Osaka Castle Park on Google maps so headed that way wondering if I'd see him but figuring I'd get a nice park walk at the very least. Ended up seeing him from across the street in an Always Sunny-esque moment. He encouraged me to visit the park alone so I did and he walked back to the house and as I turned I saw the most magnificent green moth and snapped a bunch of pics. Got to the park and was taking pics of cicada shells that appear larger than ours at home when Friend2 texted that he'd head to the park too so I waited for him. We realized that Friend1 and Friend3 weren't far behind so we waited for them too as I continued to search for creatures. The castle was very crowded and it was very hot out so we saw a cool statue and stuff and then retreated off to the side into the shade of trees to look for yet more creatures. Found a giant praying mantis and also some of their egg sacks around. Attempted to identify bird calls with no success. A rock among the trees had an interesting carving on it. We did a full loop and Friend2 and I were hungry and left for Korea Town while Friend1 and Friend3 went off somewhere else.</p>
                            
                            <p>Our cab driver to Korea Town was wonderful and pointed out a good restaurant but kept driving and I was concerned that he was waiting for us to tell him to stop. But when he finally did stop on his own we saw that he clearly knew what he was doing. He brought us to a pedestrian-only street lined with shops and food stations. Friend2 got fried chicken and lemonade and I had a delicious strawberry milk boba tea omg so gooood. I panicked when trying to order a savory pancake and accidentally ordered the beef tendon one but luckily the beef was very very small and mixed in with veggies so I barely noticed. Sauce was delicious. We walked around and shopped. Friend2 also got little hot dog things with the little rice pasta things on a stick, very good.
                            I think we had a quiet evening after Korea Town. Long nap and lots of rain and ordered a garlic master volcano pizza from Domino's. Friend4 was off on his own adventures for a very long time. Early night to prep for Nara the next day.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/8</p>
                            
                            <p>Up kinda early for Nara I think. Boy oh boy was it weird with the deer. They were everywhere and literally follow you around for crackers bought from what I called the cracker house. Other shrines as well. Then to find noodles but the place we wanted was closed. Instead went to world beer curry place. Was pretty good and we sat pleasantly outside. Then I don't remember much else. Back to Osaka? More naps? I don't know.</p>
                            
                            <p>How could I forget: giant Buddha!!!! Magnificent. I was a little buzzed and maybe cried a little. It was unlike anything I've seen in my life. A bunch of school groups were going through and kids were going through the "nostril."</p>
                            
                            <p>Probably early night again to get ready for Kyoto the next day. Oh wait almost forgot the ramen place in the rain! Friend2 and I walked for food and the rain was worse than expected and the place we wanted to go was full. We decided on takeout from some random place rather dejectedly. Then I looked around a corner for seating and found an open ramen place with ****an English menu advertised outside***** we were so happy and bathed in the warmth and had a friendly server who spoke some English and my ramen came with buttered corn on top and was sooooo delicious and needed after walking in the rain. We briefly chatted with a British bloke who sat behind us. Then a nice peaceful sleep.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/9</p>
                            
                            <p>Kyoto</p>
                            Up early for Kyoto<br>
                            I wanted to see art while Friend2 went to Nishiki Market for food. I wandered into an art gallery and a lecture was happening. They welcomed me and said I could sit and the guy filming the lecture said Bonjour and only then did I realize the artist giving a presentation about her work was also speaking French. Artist's name was Isabella something and she was showing her textile works though she also works with resin. So I got to hear an artist speak French and have it translated into Japanese. I think people were wondering what I was doing there but also were happy to have a new attendee. After the lecture I looked at the exhibition and as I was leaving a young woman said hi to me I think or waved at me and I said bonjour but she just kind of smiled and I walked off. 
                            
                            <p>Found Nishiki Market to get Friend2, it was crowded but I found a delicious omelet place and got one with chives and no hidden meats thank goodness. Sat down in a corner where I could watch them cook and saw Friend2 walk by and called him and told him to turn around. We sat while I ate my omelet and Friend2 discussed the many foods he tried (giant crab leg tempura, skewers, strawberries with chocolate, etc.) and the people he saw. Lots of tourists being fools. We walked through a bit more and found Friend3 and Friend1. Said hello for a bit and then off they went after Friend1 told us about the cute candy shops which we soon found. I finally got a gift for my mom (tea with raccoons on the packaging). We made our way out of the market and walked down a canal Friend1 had mentioned and saw birds and breathtaking views of places that look like paintings with mountains in the background. Got really hot and sunny. Got off the canal and wanted to get back to Tokyo to hang with Friend4 on his last night.</p>
                            
                            <p>Good thing we left early because what a friggin journey. Got a taxi to the station where we needed to find our lockers with our bags in them. The taxi driver was a hilarious old man and asked where we were from and explained through gestures and goofy voices (while removing his hands from the steering wheel and turning to face us) how in Japan they say happy new year calmly with a bow but Americans get all crazy and wild (he was probably thinking of Times Square because when we say we're from America people usually follow up by saying New York! And we just say yes).</p>
                            
                            At the station we were on the wrong side, walked all over creation<br>
                            Went up and up and up to sky bridge thinking we'd cross the tracks but it went parallel to the tracks and brought us up to to a place with a bunch of ramen shops but no trains or nothing<br>
                            Finally got out of the ramen room<br>
                            Eventually I asked a tourist information employee how to get to our gate. She pulled out a map and drew directions for me. Thank god it worked and was not super far.<br>
                            Got our stuff and our bullet train and saw Mount Fuji<br>
                            Rested at hotel and back out to meet Friend4 in Shinjuku<br>
                            "Do people in chicyahgo have an accent?" (At some point in the night while walking through Shinjuku some Chicagoans asked us this and said some other things.)<br>
                            Friend4's last night<br>
                            Piss alley in Shinjuku<br>
                            Sat by the fryer<br>
                            Yakitori skewers of different varieties. A very welcoming server who spoke some English. <br>
                            Chicken gizzard and skin and yes I ate them for some reason.<br>

                            <p>Also veggie ones very good with straight garlic cloves. We could smoke in there. It was a tiny ass place and getting out we had to get everyone to stand up so we could scooch behind them.</p>

                            <p>Then conbini beers and a walk to Godzilla. Then back to our hotel area for darts! Awesome! Bar and table service and the machine counts your score and takes pictures.
                            I was getting drunk because I stupidly tried to keep up with Friend4 and Friend2.</p>

                            <p>Guy next to us was really good at darts and appeared to be playing electronically with people in other locations viewable on the screen by camera</p>

                            <p>After darts one final ramen place with delicious large bottles of beer and I ate pork belly because I wanted the cabbage it came with.</p>

                            <p>Final goodbyes and bed</p>
                            
                            <p>10/10</p>
                            
                            <p>Shibuyaaaaaa</p>
                            
                            <p>Started kinda late eventually got to Shibuya around 3 PM. We were late because I was a little hungover and we'd been out until like 1:30 AM so we spent the morning snoozing and doing laundry and getting snacks and coffee. I ate a curry bun from the conbini among other things and cleaned up the room a bit and once and for all figured out how to use the remote for the air conditioner.</p>
                            
                            <p>In Shibuya went to Yoyogi Park to look for critters and see the dog park. Lots of cute dogs like a large one with a prosthetic leg, a wolf dog, a Bernese Mountain puppy, two giant floofs (one brown one white). A cute shiba-looking dog in a stroller. Many dogs in bicycle baskets. The park was beautiful and the flower garden had many of those weird moths I've been seeing. Then we got hungry and left and ate at a weird spot downstairs. Friend2 got skewers and whatnot, we finally had the Camembert croquettes. I ordered a disgusting yam porridge or something with seaweed and a raw quail egg. I felt like I had to eat at least some of it to not be rude and almost wanted to prove myself somehow as not a stupid American who accidentally ordered something they couldn't stomach. I tried to acquire a taste for it but could not; it was gross. Instead ate edamame and one of Friend2's stuffed peppers. Then we walked around the area and shopped.</p>
                            
                            Lost bar long ass line so we said no thanks.<br>
                            Weird comic book store called Mandarake down a million stairs had a million books on William Blake in all sections. Had an occult section (next to the terrifying cartoon porn) and Blake was in there too. Boxes and shelves full of plastic-wrapped second hand books, anything in English was almost exclusively literary criticism (besides but also including the William Blakes) which makes me believe they bought a large lot of books from some other old bookstore and didn't care about the contents. Must have been free or dirt cheap.<br>
                            Then we wanted the scenic view thing but turns out you need tickets 30 days in advance. Then we instead went to some government building in Shinjuku where there is a little-known free scenic view. Way better.<br>
                            Pac-Man on the light show at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building was awesome.
                            We sat and watched all the light shows.<br>
                            Then a somewhat early night after conbini sandwiches.
                            
                            <p>10/11</p>
                            
                            <p>How am I all caught up in this thing? It has been a struggle. It's unbelievable how fast this trip has gone. I already have only four days left then I leave on Wednesday. I am so excited to go home and see Bemo. No more long trips after this until he dies.</p>
                            
                            <p>I slept pretty well and so got up before Friend2 this morning and walked to the pier. There were little nature spots along the way and the water was beautiful. It was hot and sunny; I'd started out wearing a hoodie but had to remove it almost immediately. Had some coffee as I walked along and looked for critters. Maybe identified a bird. I got to Kyu-Shiba-rikyÅ« Gardens just as it was opening at 9 AM and went in behind three lovely older French ladies. I smiled and said Bonjour to one but they kept walking. The park was beautiful and perfect for a quick morning walk. I got a stamp that no one else will have probably. Saw lots of birds and koi and turtles. Then headed back and got to the hotel as Friend2 was finishing up a shower. We got our stuff together and headed to the Imperial Palace. Unfortunately we didn't know it's closed on Fridays but it still was a beautiful walk and I found some large caterpillars.</p>
                            
                            <p>Then to The National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo. It was OK. I was hoping for some super weird shit but it was more classic. I was confused about why they had all their art catalogs and annual reports on display. Then we were hungry and wanted the weird fried sandwiches. Got to the place and there was a line and we said screw that and instead found a cute upstairs place with insane pancakes and a beautiful deck place to sit. Friend2 got a delicious "vinegar drink" that I think was passion fruit shrub. He also got a tiramisu strawberry pancake and I got strawberry pistachio and they were huge and fluffy and had a bunch of delicious things all over. Then we went back to the hotel to rest. It's now 5:24 PM. Friend2 is just awakening from a short nap as I write this and we are in bed watching a calming show on TV about someone crafting some things. Time to get dressed and whatever and head out for drinks and food at the Philly cheesesteak bar with Friend2's friend from high school who moved here several months ago. Konbonwa!</p>
                            
                            <p>Cheesesteaks were delicious and the place was fun and friendly. Friend5 is awesome. Seriously the cheesesteak did not disappoint. I was hesitant to order one for myself but glad I did. Waaaaaay better than Chubby's. Then off to an Irish pub where we stood outside and people watched over beers around a table. Friend5 has a very interesting life. Then off to home and bed pretty late.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/12</p>
                            
                            <p>For future reference, ten days is when you feel content and ready to go home from vacation.</p>
                            
                            <p>Woke up early despite wanting to sleep in. Needed to get that cheesesteak out of me and a shower. Tried to rest as Friend2 got up and ready. Decided I needed a large hot breakfast and walked over to a 24-hour soba noodle place. Easy ordering with a ticket machine. Food was ready right away. Added a bunch of spice. It was pretty good and I was thankful to be able to order fried tofu and an egg without being loaded with beef. Went back to the hotel with a coffee and a pudding from the conbini. Very good pudding. Rested a little more until Friend2 was ready to venture for attempt number two of Imperial Palace. We got there and it was pretty crowded and the line for guided tour was long so we opted for the free gardens with a much faster-moving line. Beautiful and full of giant spiders! Also the crows were flocking around the beautiful huge old fruit trees. Giant limes I think too? Citrus Maximus. It was very hot so next move was shaved ice! Very good and weird. We got fig and waguri which I think is chestnut. Then back to the hotel for rest. Once again I'm sitting here around 5:30 PM as Friend2 awakes and we watch a goofy Japanese comedy show of some kind. Thinking of what to do this eve. Hoping to take it easy because want to be fresh for cat festival tomorrow!</p>
                            
                            <p>We went to Asakusa and saw a beautiful lit temple at night and incredible market place with a few shops still open. Found a weird spot to sit outside and eat and more importantly people watch. Slightly annoying young folk next to us, eventually some fun Detroiters sat on the other side. We (us and the Detroiters) shared in the amazement that things don't get stolen here (bikes, grills, etc.). The food was weird so we left. Walked around some more and found Not Suspicious, a bar recommended to Friend1 that she then recommended to us. Paper drawings all over the walls and incredibly fun bartenders who drank with us. Met some young folks from another town in Japan who could speak some English. One beer and one "not suspicious" shot and it was time for an early night.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/13</p>
                            
                            I slept quite well but Friend2 did not. He's currently resting as I make my way up to Friend1's area on the subway so we can register for Bake Neko!<br>
                            Ridiculous cat festival<br>
                            I arrived early with Friend1 and Friend3<br>
                            We searched for stamps and temples<br>
                            So many weird costumes<br>
                            Friend2 arrived later<br>
                            We ate snacks (fried potato and a delicious strawberry cream drink) and danced in the parade<br>
                            Then had some beers in a downstairs chamber<br>
                            Then Friend3 left and the three remaining searched for fabric and thrift shops. They were all closed because it was Sunday eve before a holiday (sports day on Monday)<br>
                            Found some weird trash clothes thrift store, don't even know how to describe it. I couldn't stay because it was very claustrophobia inducing and smelled weird. Friend2 and Friend1 found weird thrift shirts but nothing worth buying.<br>
                            Tired and over it, we went our separate ways. Friend1 to Nikko and me and Friend2 to our hotel. Trip is winding down for me. Showered and fell asleep watching TV.
                            
                            <p>10/14</p>
                            
                            Fish market<br>
                            Mr. Cheese<br>
                            <p>Up early for the Tsukiji fish market. Wow! Raw fish for breakfast. Enjoyed the tuna sashimi. Also got the delicious egg stick (tomayaki). Some more walking and a bite of Friend2's wagyu beef stick. The woman who sold it to him spoke English and asked where were from and seemed to be the first Japanese person who recognized Philadelphia and said "Mr. Cheese" in reference to cheesesteaks. Then we walked upstairs into a peaceful cafe for strawberry shaved ice and delicious ginger ale. Walked back home for a nap. Woke up and are now preparing to head to our pro wrestling match. This should be weird.</p>
                            
                            <p>The wrestling venue was awesome. Food and drink stands outside. We got beers and chilled. A wrestler came out and everyone was crowding around him. Friend2 asked someone who he was and the person excitedly said the wrestler's name. Friend2 looked him up, some retired guy I think. Friend5 met us outside. We all got in easily and were excited for food but there were somehow no food stands inside. This was a problem. We got lemon sour alcohol drinks but there was no food so Friend2 ate Doritos and something else. Too many lemon sours. Friend2 was super drunk. I was pretty drunk too but somehow got us home on the subway. I remember like holding onto Friend2 to make sure he wouldn't wobble onto the train tracks. He went to bed, I stayed out a little and wandered to find a bar but it's weirdly hard to find a place where you can just sit and drink without ordering food. Especially because it was a holiday (sports day). Eventually went to the highball place around the corner from us and got a beer and delicious (though maybe kind of Americanized) takoyaki. It was pretty boring there so I left. Wandered some more I think before buying alcohol at a 711 and going to the hotel. Don't remember going to bed but apparently I did.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/15</p>
                            
                            <p>Did not stick exactly to plan. Friend2 was not feeling well in the morning so I went to Jimbocho Book Town alone after we downed some McDonald's breakfast in the room. It was pretty cool. Until I went into a bookstore and picked out a cool art book to look at in the cafe. I was nearing the end of the book when a woman asked if the book was mine and I said no and she said I wasn't allowed to view it in the cafe. Weird. So I left and wandered and got a yummy BÃ¡nh mÃ¬
                            sandwich and looked for funny DVDs for Sam (only ones available in English were two copies of the movie Kids. Weird.). Then hopped on the train to Yanaka which is an old timey town with shops and whatnot and supposedly a bunch of stray cats. I didn't see any cats. Friend2 arrived and we walked through some shrines and through the Yanaka cemetery. Still no cats but we enjoyed the peaceful, leisurely walk. Realized we were near the zoo so headed there but it was closed :( so instead we went down to the large pond with water lilies and rented a swan paddle boat. That was fun. Then we walked to get sushi and found this insane set of alleys with shops and food and it may have been little Thailand. People just drinking and smoking outside. Friend2 got a kebab sandwich. Then we went to Sushiro and I ate a bunch of different sushies from the conveyor belt system. Fun! Then we did some shopping for weird t-shirts and boy did we find them. Naked lady shirts and others. The store clerks were a little invasive. So then we went back to the freshly cleaned hotel room, showered, and prepped for my morning departure. Fell asleep early watching TV.</p>
                            
                            <p>10/16</p>
                            
                            <p>Woke up this morning for a final cig and trip to 711. I ate a bunch of omelet rice and a melon bread because I felt like I had to try them. Kind of regretted it. Friend2 got me to the monorail which was very hectic. He saw me off and it was me on my own. Passed by the horse park too quickly to get a pic, but I saw some horses. Made it to the airport and somehow got my bag checked and whatnot. Now sitting and waiting to board. Peace out, Japan. Looking forward to my bed and my cat.</p>
                            
                            <p>Crazy how quickly we get used to things. I already kind of miss that little stinky hotel room and even the AirBnB in Osaka that made me miserable because of the shower and toilet being in separate rooms. I will miss the clean streets and feeling like I can get anywhere in 20 minutes on the subway. New York doesn't feel so intimidating now. I think I would need years to fully experience Japan.</p>

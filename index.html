									<h2>Me and this website</h2>
									
									<p>I worry way too much about properly citing everything.</p>

									<p>I started building websites for fun when I was around ten or so years old because the internet was new and weird at the time and so was I, I guess.</p>

									<p>This site was created in November 2022 as an experiment and creative outlet. It has changed a lot over the years.</p>

									<p>More recently I found a bunch of retro-style websites reminiscent of the 90s and wanted my creative outlet back.</p>

									<p>This website is coded with love and mild frustration by Yours Truly using Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, and GitHub. It's best viewed on a desktop computer or laptop. I make most of the graphics using Paint Shop Pro 7 and <a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/"
										target="_blank">GIMP</a>. Anything I did not make is either in the public domain or is credited somewhere.</p>
									
								   <p>Much of the internet these days is a hellscape of corporate sameness, lack of privacy, AI slop,
									and clickbait nonsense with no substance. We can still have an internet where people can express themselves and share important information, but it seems we have to build it ourselves. This is my little attempt at my own corner of
									the web that I can spruce up and display to the world.</p>

                <p>I worked at a beer bar for a good chunk of my life when I was a post-college, directionless young person. I look back fondly on those years, mainly because of the people I met and the things I learned, but also because I developed a taste
                    for craft beer. Here I will try to remember and describe some of my favorites.</p>

                            <p>(Image from an in-game screenshot)</p>

                            <p>I almost can't believe this happened! It's April 2025 and the new season of <em>Black Mirror</em> is out. I watched up to episode four, 'Plaything,' and can't get this out of my mind.</p>

                            <p>The episode involves a PC game in which the player cares for little alien-looking things that are touted as artificial life. They can learn and 'think' for themselves, and the player's goal is to care for them and hope they
                                reproduce for many generations.</p>

                            <p>My immediate thought was how similar this concept is to the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_(1996_video_game)" target="_blank"><em>Creatures</em></a>, a 1996 life simulation. I received <em>Creatures</em>                                as a gift when I was eight years old, and the box very much tried to sell me on the idea that the subjects of the game were truly alive in some way. Seriously: Everything on the box was 'really alive' this and 'greatest
                                artificial life experiment in the world' that. You can still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6yzxBB73lg" target="_blank">watch the game's original tutorial</a> that says something like that.</p>

                            <p>I was obsessed with the game for a while and still play it nowadays. You can get it for pretty cheap on GOG or Steam and it easily runs on most systems. But I'm confused why there hasn't really been anything like it released
                                ever since. There have been similar ideas around 'living' things on the computer like <em>Petz</em>, <em>Spore</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, etc. But I don't think any of those games use a neural network as effectively as <em>Creatures</em> did. Yes--the game is an early example of a simple neural network. The aliens in the game, called Norns, learn through trial-and-error how to do things that are good, like eat, and how to avoid things that cause pain, like
                                touching fire. Some of them are better at it than others, but as the player you can encourage or discourage them from doing things.</p>

                            <p>You can teach the Norns how to speak in a rudimentary language and then communicate with them by typing short sentences like 'get food,' but they often don't listen. Or maybe that's just my experience; I've never been a remarkably
                                assertive person. But one of the coolest parts of the language-learning mechanic is that Norns can also learn from each other, so if you teach your adult Norn a bunch of plainbox then let it play with a child who hasn't been
                                taught anything, the child can learn plainbox from the adult. Or... the adult might instead pick up on the child's babble, and you have to re-teach your adult lest it start asking for 'oogh' instead of 'food.'</p>

                            <p>Anyway, you'll never believe this but apparently Charlie Brooker, writer of <em>Black Mirror</em>, was a reviewer and fan of <em>Creatures</em> before moving on to writing TV shows. A Redditor tracked down <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CreaturesGames/comments/1jz61h4/i_managed_to_track_down_black_mirror_writer/"
                                target="_blank">Charlie's 1996 review in <em>PC Zone</em></a>. I'm thrilled and amazed that a writer of a show I love was such a fan of a game I love, and even more amazed that the game inspired a whole episode of the show!
                                I hope this will bring <em>Creatures</em> back into the spotlight so others can appreciate how cool it is, and maybe it will be revitalized in some way.</p>

                            <summary><img src="art/tinblst.gif"> Fin Fin</summary>
                            <p>Here's a weird one for you, and you will most likely see a trend in the types of games I enjoy as this list goes along. But hear me out: This game involved watching a dolphin/bird hybrid creature on what was advertised as a
                                camera on another planet. I'm not kidding. Please read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_Fin_on_Teo_the_Magic_Planet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                            <p>But if you want to hear my take on it, it was literally magic as a child and is incredibly boring as an adult. From what I've read about it, a lot of effort went into making the graphics look real, and by golly did I believe
                                that shit was real when I was eight or nine years old. Now it looks a bit pixelly. Side note: You can find the game online nowadays but last time I tried it was difficult to install and required use of a virtual machine
                                running Windows 95 because it will not run on Windows 10 or above.</p>

                            <p>As far as game play, you basically watch this dolphin bird as it perches on a tree. His name is Fin Fin and he occasionally does interesting things at random. He might sing a song, flap his wings, or fly off to a different
                                location that you can follow him to using a really cool-looking map. Like seriously, the graphics and sounds in this game were beyond enchanting when I was a kid. I'll never forget the first time I played the game on my
                                best friend's computer during a sleepover. It was what felt like incredibly late at night when we booted it up and we probably did not sleep because my friend was fortunate enough to have a giant old desktop PC in her bedroom
                                upstairs and we did nothing but watch that damn dolphin bird all night.</p>

                            <p>When I played <em>Fin Fin</em> as an adult, it was underwhelming. You watch and wait for him to do stuff. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. If anything the cooler part is that occasional other creatures will pop up on
                                the screen, like insects or floaty jellyfish things or other birds. You can also feed Fin Fin but I've never had much luck with that. The other part I forgot to mention is that, in a thing that was totally cool at the time
                                but never seems to have taken off and made it to today, you could 'talk' to Fin Fin using a microphone. Even as a kid, I lost interest in this pretty quick because you can talk into the microphone all you want and Fin Fin
                                doesn't respond unless you make an incredibly loud noise, which actually upsets him. I remember being nearly traumatized the first time I made a too-loud noise and Fin Fin shrieked, took flight, and disappeared into the
                                woods.</p>

                            <p>Overall though this game is a really cool concept and yet another artifical-life type thing from my childhood that I don't understand why it hasn't been reborn today but with better technology. Nowadays I watch a bald eagle
                                nest via livestream on YouTube and basically feel like I am playing adult <em>Fin Fin</em>.</p>

                            <p>(Image from an in-game screenshot)</p>

                            <p>I first played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogz_and_Catz" target="_blank">Dogz</a> on my friend's computer and fell in love. It's just a cute little pixelated dog that you adopt (after choosing from I think five
                                breed options) and it runs around on your desktop. You can give the dog treats, toys, and pets, and it responds to you. I begged my parents for this game of course, but my dad went all out and got me Dogz 3, which I had
                                not known existed. </p>
                            <p> What an upgrade! In Dogz 3, you can adopt multiple computer doggos and bring them to various places like the garden, beach, and living room. You get a whole closet full of toys and clothes for them. The dogs start as puppies
                                and grow up, and when they are adults you can breed them so they have cute little puppies with mixed physical characteristics from their parents! You can't get much cuter than that, and you definitely can't get more of
                                a perfect game for eight-year-old me. </p>

                            <p>Another really cool thing about this game is the online community it formed. A lot of players of the game, including me, created their own little websites dedicated to their Dogz (and Catz, which was the same game but with
                                cats) family. People got really creative with it and started making their own toys, clothes, and breeds of animals for the game, and making them available for download on their websites. Even dog and cat shows started cropping
                                up, with sets of rules for each type of show, similar to the real-life American Kennel Club and the like. If you poke around on certain corners of the internet, you can still find websites like this.</p>

                            <p>I admit it. In addition to being weirdly obsessed with pet related computer games, I was also a horse girl. I rode horses as a hobby and damn was it cool.</p>
                            <p>But <em>Riding Star</em> was pretty cool as far as horse games go. You probably have not scoured the web for an actually good horse game, but I have, and I can tell you that most horse video games are absolute garbage. Either the horse looks like a maniac or the human looks like a maniac or both, and you either need to painfully walk slowly through every interaction in the game as they try to make it as realistic as possible, or all you get to do is like run around in a field or something. Seriously: If you find a good horse game, first tell me about it and then cherish that game forever because it's probably not real.</p>

                            <p>Back to the actual game. You play as a young woman caring for a horse named Star, and it's fairly relaxing and even a little engaging to poke around the stables, groom your horse, clean the stall and make sure there's food and water, and even let your horse out into the pasture for a while. However you care for your horse will impact his overall health and subsequently his ability to compete, which is the slightly more engaging part of the game. Using your keyboard and an interesting perspective that I forget the name of, you can take your horse to competitions in dressage, show jumping, and cross country. The way these competitions work are actually pretty fun and bonus points for the cheeky British sports announcer who can only say a handful of unique phrases but adds a nice touch. There's also a fun multiplayer mode that lets you select different horses and I'm still serious when I say this game does horse competitions eight-hundred-times better than any other horse game I've ever played. And I've played a lot of horse games, including <em>Barbie Riding Club</em>. There will not be a section on this page for <em>Barbie Riding Club</em>.</p>

                            <p>I am currently obsessed with a college radio show on KXLU, Loyola Marymount University (88.9fm in Los Angeles, but I listen on <a href="http://goodradio.org/juke/" target="_blank">the GoodRadio Jukebox</a>) called the Zoo Croo,
                                hosted by the Rattler. I highly recommend tuning into KXLU from 6AM - 9AM Pacific Standard Time to hear the Rattler and, apparently near Christmas, Felipe the rat AKA LA's favorite rodent, who may or may not be the Rattler
                                putting on a different voice and acting as a rat.</p>

                            <p>The Rattler is hilarious and weird, but also comes across as a nice guy despite his raspy voice and habit of advertising events that sound too ridiculous to be real. He plays awesome music and takes callers and occasionally
                                gets interesting characters on the line who may or may not be the Rattler doing a different voice. I don't know, I just started listening to this show recently and it's hard to find much information about it.

                            <p>I have ALWAYS had vivid dreams, for as long as I can remember. My partner, on the other hand, almost never has vivid dreams. Hearing him talk about dreams is usually a special treat. Listening to a person's dreams in general
                                can be difficult because how can something so vivid and intense to one person be so meaningless to the other? I often refrain from talking about my dreams unless they are particularly wild because, really, who wants to
                                hear about them otherwise? They're often pretty mundane once I'm fully awake and can really think about them. But I enjoy the rare occasions of hearing about other people's dreams.</p>

                            <p><em><a href="https://museariadne.neocities.org/" target="_blank">muse ariadne</a> prompt week of may 5: write about a nude body! this doesn't have to be sexual, obviously. write about one in a way that makes sense to you</em></p>

                            <p>The strangest context to see a nude body, in my opinion, is in art class. Suddenly it's perfectly acceptable to be in a classroom with a nude adult standing in the center of the room, and you're told to paint that nude person.
                                I did this in college one time. It ended up being one of the better paintings of my college years, and I might actually still have the painting somewhere. (I threw most of my college art away during a particularly difficult
                                move.) I remember when the nude model donned a robe and walked around to view our paintings and I was nervous that they'd be offended by how I portrayed them. My professor liked my painting and noted that the model had
                                'weight' and said something about the color I used to describe the inside part of her arm that wasn't facing the light. It was a reddish color. I was learning how to paint shadows without adding black to every color to
                                darken it. It was working for me that day. That day with the nude body.</p>

                            <p>
                                I am proud and happy to say that I am witnessing what's called <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/understanding_tree_reversions" target="_blank">genetic reversion</a> in a tree in my front yard. I have what appears
                                to be a
                                <a href="https://bartstreeservice.com/large-tree-growing-out-dwarf-alberta-spruce/" target="_blank">dwarf Alberta spruce</a> in my font yard and not only is it growing at a pretty interesting rate but I noticed one day
                                that one of its branches is much longer and, quite frankly, looks like a different type of tree. As you'll find if you search the internet for genetic reversion in trees, it looks as though a different kind of tree is growing
                                out of the host tree. I don't fully understand the science behind it, but apparently leaving the tree as-is may cause the genetically reverting section of the tree to fully take over, which I think would be really cool.
                                I don't own the property so I don't give a damn if that whole dwarf Alberta spruce turns into a towering white spruce and takes over the yard. I think that would be neat.
                            </p>

                            <p>I'll eventually share photos of the spruce in my yard with the reversion happening.</p>

                            <p>Honestly I am not in a good creative mode right now, and I wonder if others also straight up tell themselves when they're not feeling creative. Or, I guess I wonder how consistently creative people handle their moments of non-creativity.
                                I am a regimented person, usually, so I enjoy routine, and I recently told myself I would do one creative thing per day. It can be anything really: writing, drawing, maybe even cooking could count. Even if I just draw one
                                line in my notebook, it counts as long as I am taking that moment to attempt to feel creative. So I'm pretty much forcing this one out of myself right now. I'm not even really following the prompt now. I just wanted to
                                get something out for today, and I wonder if others do this. My logic is that staying in the daily habit of doing something like this will eventually lead to a day of free-flowing creativity! Whoop-dee-doo!

                                <li>One medium-sized package of frozen corn, no need to thaw</li>
                                <li>One can (probably 15oz) diced tomatoes</li>
                                <li>Handful of minced garlic</li>
                                <li>A few splashes of really hot sauce (like ghost pepper hot)</li>

                                <li>Maybe 1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
                                <li>Two 12oz cans of black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
                                <li>Salt, pepper, and cinnamon to taste</li>

                                    <li>Add minced garlic and onions, maybe some olive oil if needed.</li>
                                    <li>Add the broken up plant-based crumbles and one package of chili seasoning. Cook for a while, until you feel the crumbles are cooked and the onions/garlic are nice and smelly.</li>
                                    <li>Start slowly adding vegetable stock just so the pot doesn't get too dry.</li>
                                    <li>Add the tomato paste and diced tomatoes. Keep the heat at medium/medium high.</li>
                                    <li>Add the beans and corn and cook for a little bit. Add the second package of chili seasoning and more vegetable stock to get it nice and juicy.</li>
                                    <li>Increase the heat if needed to get a nice simmer going.</li>
                                    <li>Dump in some hot sauce. Make sure you taste the chili as you do this so you don't make it too spicy.</li>
                                    <li>Dump in some parmesan cheese if you accidentally made the chili too spicy.</li>

                        <p>I had a delicious, similar flatbread at a nearby restaurant and was inspired to create my own! Goddamn, fontina cheese must be the greatest cheese.</p>

                            <p>Ingredients:</p>
                                <ul>

                            <summary><img src="art/tinierpumpkin.png"> The veggie sandwich they used to make at the restaurant I used to work at</summary>
                            <p>This one has a story. When I worked in a restaurant they made this delicious veggie sandwich that I ordered all the time. Then they stopped making it. I was sad, but my friend working in the kitchen said, "Briana, you know
                                the ingredients. You can make the sandwich yourself." "But it won't be the same!" I protested. Fast-forward to many years later, when I finally decided to try making this sandwich myself. It absolutely was not the same.
                                The ingredients are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>hummus</li>
                                <li>feta cheese</li>
                                <li>kalamata olives</li>
                                <li>roasted red peppers</li>
                                <li>tomatoes</li>
                                <li>mixed greens</li>
                                <li>ciabatta bread</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>My theories on why it's not the same when I make it:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I can never find good ciabatta bread at the store.</li>
                                <li>The hummus at the restaurant was made in the restaurant. I will never be able to buy or make that exact hummus.</li>
                                <li>Typically when I used to order the sandwich I would order it with a side of fries, and the fries at this place were delicious. I will never be able to replicate those fries.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>So that is my sandwich story.</p>

                                <br> Easy enough. I used broccoli and other veggies instead of chicken. I think I would like it spicier.

                                split (it does), and not knowing if we'd cooked the cream slowly enough (we hadn't).

                               I had a dream last night that H. Jon Benjamin had his own cooking show and I really wish it was real.

                            <p>
                                I recently read <a href="https://gridphilly.com/blog-home/2025/12/01/how-to-forage-wild-persimmons/" target="_blank"> an article about persimmons</a> and was intrigued by how the fruit's flesh is described as 'pudding-like.'
                                I bought a Hachiya persimmon from my favorite market, waited a day to get the perfect ripeness (apparently, similar to an avocado, persimmon has a very small window of perfect ripeness which happens basically right before
                                the persimmon is rotten), then dug in with a spoon. It was delicious and only a little pudding-like.

There is also Kazakh the dog who appears in <em> Galápagos</em> and is also apparently a different dog, though I kind of thought of them all as the same dog in different universes.</p>

                                statement on the inside cover). Some research revealed that this book is volume five of an eight-volume set, and is somewhat valuable if you have the entire set in good condition. Mine is not a full set and is in very bad condition.
                                I liked some of these stories and did not really like some of the others, I think in part because I read in bed and sometimes fall asleep during key moments.</p>

                                things like that). Basically witch hunts are used by powerful people to dehumanize others so they can stay in power, and they continue to this day. Did not finish, for some reason.</p>

                                just so fun and funny! Nevermind that actually solving the mystery myself was probably impossible.</p>

                            <p> Interesting look into the childhood of a comedian I admire. I discovered Alan Davies while watching cable TV in London and warming up to shows like <em>QI</em> and <em>Taskmaster</em>. My friend and I have particularly fond
                                memories of getting back to our flat at night--arms loaded with unfamiliar snacks from the grocery store down the street--and popping on the telly to wind down and absorb some culture. I somehow found out that Davies had
                                a painful childhood and, being always attracted to sad comedians because I somehow relate to their desperate need for everyone to like them, I decided to read his memoir. I remember it being very sad and sometimes amusing.</p>

                            <p> I don't remember finishing this book because I hated it so much. Just not my style, I guess. The author tried very hard to sound snarky and it wasn't landing for me.</p>

                            <p> History is not my strong suit but this was a really interesting look at the problematic relations between colonists and Native Americans. Completely different justice systems, all kinds of bias, corruption, etc. Very eye-opening.
                                I didn't think I could hate colonialism more but here we are.</p>

                            <p> Another surprise joy from what I expected to be a dusty old classic. I'd had a bad experience with Dickens after trying to read <em>Great Expectations</em> in high school with an English teacher who I despised. This was a much
                                more pleasant experience and proves why it is such a classic.</p>

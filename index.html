            <p>My name is Briana and I'm an artist in Philadelphia. I like to draw, paint, and mess around with coding and pixel art. I also garden and do other things sometimes. You've stumbled upon my little digital space for displaying my work and sharing the questionable outcomes of my hobbies. Thanks for stopping by!</p>

                <h2>Digital sketches and experimentation</h2>

                <p>I recently started experimenting with digital sketching after rediscovering 'retro' style websites and pixel art. More to come.</p>

                 <h2>Paint, pencil, paper, canvas, pastel, charcoal, etc.</h2>

                 <p>I studied fine/studio arts in college where I practiced a variety of media. I occasionally still dabble in painting and drawing. These are presented in no particular order.</p>

            <h2>What I'm up to now</h2>
            <p>As of July 2024. Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank>">Derek Sivers</a></p>

            <hr>

                <p><h3>Reading</h3> House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski and loving the zany ~*~experience~*~. Also just started Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain as I can pretty much always go for a classic.</p>

                <p><h3>Nature</h3> I take regular walks or jogs in the Wissahickon Valley Park and am just in love with that place. Nature has been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember, beginning with my love of running around barefoot in my backyard, climbing trees and observing ants for way too long. I used to try all different trails in Philly but now pretty much stick to the same ones, and I enjoy noticing how the same trails look different every time I'm there, even from one day to the next.</p>

                <p><h3>Art</h3> I have a weird relationship with art these days. I love being creative but often struggle to feel motivated to paint for myself without some kind of external purpose. Luckily a friend recently asked me to paint something to hang in her living room, so I now have a goal to achieve.</p>

                <p><h3>Cooking</h3> I hated cooking up until a few years ago and I am now obsessed with trying a new recipe every week. I adore farmer's markets and eating seasonally/locally whenever I can. My new favorite type of movie or TV show is one that involves food in some way; I recently watched Green Book (2018) and in addition to it being my favorite movie I've seen this year, I could not get enough of the insanely charming food scenes. I immediately needed to cook spaghetti with (vegetarian) meatballs after watching it. </p>

                <p><h3>Travel</h3> My friends and I traveled to Montreal in June. I have a long history of visiting Montreal with my best friend, including living there for a month after we graduated college. This was the first time we'd gone together since 2015, and the first time bringing our partners. Montreal is such a beautiful city and its residents are always so welcoming. I've officially been converted from someone who didn't understand the hype around poutine to someone who cannot stop thinking about the delicious mushroom poutine I had from a food truck.</p>

                <h3>What is this?</h3>

                <p>I started building websites for fun when I was around ten or so years old because the internet was new and weird at the time and so was I, I guess.</p>

                <p>This site was created in November 2022 as an experiment and creative outlet. It has changed a lot over the years.</p>

                <p>More recently I found a bunch of retro-style websites reminiscent of the 90s and wanted my creative outlet back.</p>

                <p>This website is coded with love and mild frustration by Yours Truly using Visual Studio Code and GitHub. I make the graphics using Paint Shop Pro 7 and Gimp. The site is viewable on a mobile device but is best viewed on a larger screen
                    of some kind, I guess a PC or whatever.</p>

                    <p>I worked at a beer bar for a good chunk of my life when I was a post-college, directionless young person. I look back fondly on those years, mainly because of the people I met and the things I learned, but also because I developed
                        a taste for craft beer. Here I will try to remember and describe some of my favorites.</p>

                    <p>I also have some interesting attempts at making beer-related pixel art. Enjoy my amateur creations!</p>

                    <strong> Yards Tavern Spruce </strong>holds a special place in my heart because it was the first beer that I really liked and that had a flavor I could recognize. It really does have a spruce taste to it and this is how I learned that I enjoy floral beers.

                     <strong>Tro&#x308;egs Mad Elf:</strong> What a doozy! 'Tis the season! I can have maybe one of these per year because they are mighty strong in both alcohol content and flavor. It's also fun that the batch is slightly different every year.

            <p>I played a lot of weird PC games as a kid, and still play some of them. I will dedicate this area to those games.</p>

            <h3>Games List</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><details>
                    <summary>Creatures</summary>
                    <p>I almost can't believe this happened! It's April 2025 and the new season of <em>Black Mirror</em> is out. I watched up to episode four, "Plaything," and can't get this out of my mind.</p>

                    <p>The episode involves a PC game in which the player cares for little alien-looking things that are touted as artificial life. They can learn and 'think' for themselves, and the player's goal is to care for them and hope they reproduce for many generations.</p>

                    <p>My immediate thought was how similar this concept is to the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatures_(1996_video_game)" target="_blank"><em>Creatures</em></a>, a 1996 life simulation. I received <em>Creatures</em> as a gift when I was eight years old, and the box very much tried to sell me on the idea that the subjects of the game were truly alive in some way. Seriously: Everything on the box was 'really alive' this and 'greatest artificial life experiment in the world' that. You can still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6yzxBB73lg" target="_blank" >watch the game's original tutorial</a> that says something like that.</p>

                    <p>I was obsessed with the game for a while and still play it nowadays. You can get it for pretty cheap on GOG or Steam and it easily runs on most systems. But I'm confused why there hasn't really been anything like it released ever since. There have been similar ideas around 'living' things on the computer like <em>Petz</em>, <em>Spore</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, etc. But I don't think any of those games use a neural network as effectively as <em>Creatures</em> did. Yes--the game is an early example of a simple neural network. The aliens in the game, called Norns, learn through trial-and-error how to do things that are good, like eat, and how to avoid things that cause pain, like touching fire. Some of them are better at it than others, but as the player you can encourage or discourage them from doing things.</p>

                    <p>You can teach the Norns how to speak in a rudimentary language and then communicate with them by typing short sentences like 'get food,' but they often don't listen. Or maybe that's just my experience; I've never been a remarkably assertive person. But one of the coolest parts of the language-learning mechanic is that Norns can also learn from each other, so if you teach your adult Norn a bunch of words then let it play with a child who hasn't been taught anything, the child can learn words from the adult. Or... the adult might instead pick up on the child's babble, and you have to re-teach your adult lest it start asking for 'oogh' instead of 'food.'</p>

                    <p>Anyway, you'll never believe this but apparently Charlie Brooker, writer of <em>Black Mirror</em>, was a reviewer and fan of <em>Creatures</em> before moving on to writing TV shows. A Redditor tracked down <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CreaturesGames/comments/1jz61h4/i_managed_to_track_down_black_mirror_writer/" target="_blank">Charlie's 1996 review in <em>PC Zone</em></a>. I'm thrilled and amazed that a writer of a show I love was such a fan of a game I love, and even more amazed that the game inspired a whole episode of the show! I hope this will bring <em>Creatures</em> back into the spotlight so others can appreciate how cool it is, and maybe it will be revitalized in some way.</p>

                        <summary>Fin Fin</summary>
                        <p>Here's a weird one for you, and you will most likely see a trend in the types of games I enjoy as this list goes along. But hear me out: This game involved watching a dolphin/bird hybrid creature on what was advertised as a camera on another planet. I'm not kidding. Please read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_Fin_on_Teo_the_Magic_Planet" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>But if you want to hear my take on it, it was literally magic as a child and is incredibly boring as an adult. From what I've read about it, a lot of effort went into making the graphics look real, and by golly did I believe that shit was real when I was eight or nine years old. Now it looks a bit pixelly. Side note: You can find the game online nowadays but last time I tried it was difficult to install and required use of a virtual machine running Windows 95 because it will not run on Windows 10 or above.</p>

                        <p>As far as game play, you basically watch this dolphin bird as it perches on a tree. His name is Fin Fin and he occasionally does interesting things at random. He might sing a song, flap his wings, or fly off to a different location that you can follow him to using a really cool-looking map. Like seriously, the graphics and sounds in this game were beyond enchanting when I was a kid. I'll never forget the first time I played the game on my best friend's computer during a sleepover. It was what felt like incredibly late at night when we booted it up and we probably did not sleep because my friend was fortunate enough to have a giant old desktop PC in her bedroom upstairs and we did nothing but watch that damn dolphin bird all night.</p>

                        <p>When I played <em>Fin Fin</em> as an adult, it was underwhelming. You watch and wait for him to do stuff. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. If anything the cooler part is that occasional other creatures will pop up on the screen, like insects or floaty jellyfish things or other birds. You can also feed Fin Fin but I've never had much luck with that. The other part I forgot to mention is that, in a thing that was totally cool at the time but never seems to have taken off and made it to today, you could 'talk' to Fin Fin using a microphone. Even as a kid, I lost interest in this pretty quick because you can talk into the microphone all you want and Fin Fin doesn't respond unless you make an incredibly loud noise, which actually upsets him. I remember being nearly traumatized the first time I made a too-loud noise and Fin Fin shrieked, took flight, and disappeared into the woods.</p>

                        <p>Overall though this game is a really cool concept and yet another artifical-life type thing from my childhood that I don't understand why it hasn't been reborn today but with better technology. Nowadays I watch a bald eagle nest via livestream on YouTube and basically feel like I am playing adult <em>Fin Fin</em>.</p>

            <p>Genetic Reversion</p>
            <p>
                I am proud and happy to say that I am witnessing what's called <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/understanding_tree_reversions" target="_blank">genetic reversion</a> in a tree in my front yard. I have what appears to be a <a href="https://bartstreeservice.com/large-tree-growing-out-dwarf-alberta-spruce/" target="_blank">dwarf Alberta spruce</a> in my font yard and not only is it growing at a pretty interesting rate but I noticed one day that one of its branches is much longer and, quite frankly, looks like a different type of tree. As you'll find if you search the internet for genetic reversion in trees, it looks as though a different kind of tree is growing out of the host tree. I don't fully understand the science behind it, but apparently leaving the tree as-is may cause the genetically reverting section of the tree to fully take over, which I think would be really cool. I don't own the property so I don't give a damn if that whole dwarf Alberta spruce turns into a towering white spruce and takes over the yard. I think that would be neat.
            </p>

            <p>I'll eventually share photos of the spruce in my yard with the reversion happening.</p>

                <p><em><a href="https://museariadne.neocities.org/" target="_blank">muse ariadne</a> prompt week of mar 3rd: write about something you wonder if others do, too</em></p>
                <p>Honestly I am not in a good creative mode right now, and I wonder if others also straight up tell themselves when they're not feeling creative. Or, I guess I wonder how consistently creative people handle their moments of non-creativity.
                    I am a regimented person, usually, so I enjoy routine, and I recently told myself I would do one creative thing per day. It can be anything really: writing, drawing, maybe even cooking could count. Even if I just draw one line in my
                    notebook, it counts as long as I am taking that moment to attempt to feel creative. So I'm pretty much forcing this one out of myself right now. I'm not even really following the prompt now. I just wanted to get something out for today,
                    and I wonder if others do this. My logic is that staying in the daily habit of doing something like this will eventually lead to a day of free-flowing creativity! Whoop-dee-doo!

                            You know how some recipes are not written very well and are difficult to follow? This was not one of those. The instructions were quite clear. 10/10 on recipe-writing. I subbed Halloumi cheese for shrimp; it had a stronger flavor than I expected but overall the dish was good.

                            <p>This one has a story. When I worked in a restaurant they made this delicious veggie sandwich that I ordered all the time. Then they stopped making it. I was sad, but my friend working in the kitchen said, "Briana, you know the ingredients. You can make
                            the sandwich yourself." "But it won't be the same!" I protested. Fast-forward to many years later, when I finally decided to try making this sandwich myself. It absolutely was not the same. The ingredients are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>hummus</li>
                                <li>feta cheese</li>
                                <li>kalamata olives</li>
                                <li>roasted red peppers</li>
                                <li>tomatoes</li>
                                <li>mixed greens</li>
                                <li>focaccia</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>My theories on why it's not the same when I make it:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I can never find good focaccia at the store.</li>
                                <li>The hummus at the restaurant was made in the restaurant. I will never be able to buy or make that exact hummus.</li>
                                <li>Typically when I used to order the sandwich I would order it with a side of fries, and the fries at this place were delicious. I will never be able to replicate those fries.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>So that is my sandwich story.</p>

                            <p>So far this book has been a pleasant surprise. I borrowed it from the library wanting to learn how to be a witch or something, but instead am receiving stories about witch hunts and how they are comparable to modern-day 'witch hunts' (think the Communism McCarthy trials and things like that). Basically witch hunts are used by powerful people to dehumanize others so they can stay in power, and they continue to this day.</p>

                    <p>So... I don't remember where I found this book but I think it was in one of those little free libraries or in a box on the sidewalk. Regardless, the book is incredibly old and is one of 1,050 copies printed (according to a statement on the inside cover). Some research revealed that this book is volume 5 of an 8-volume set, and is somewhat valuable if you have the entire set in good condition. Mine is not a full set and is in very bad condition. I liked some of these stories and did not really like some of the others, I think in part because I read in bed and sometimes fall asleep during key moments.</p>

                                <p>So goofy and fun. One of those books where there's no real plot; all of the events are regular day-to-day things that could happen to anyone, but described in a way that makes them hilarious and meaningful.</p>

                                <p> Some insanely beautiful poems in here. A good way to feel sadness through the words of others.</p>

                                <p> What a zany adventure! I must have looked like a weirdo flipping around in this book and turning it upside down while reading it on the bus.</p>

                                <p> Some hilarious experiments with artificial intelligence. My favorite was when it was asked to generate new ice cream flavors and one of them was 'Chocoloate chocolate chocolate chocolate road.' &#128514;</p>

                                <p> Interesting thoughts on how things like streaming services and whatnot are changing the way we interact with media. We don't buy things anymore; we license them. Is this going to cause problems? Yes and no.</p>

                                <p> So much fun! I think I imagined this would be tedious and weird because of its age, but how ageist of me. Supposedly this is not even one of Christie's best works but I adored it nonetheless and want to read more of hers. Honestly just so fun and funny! Nevermind that actually solving the mystery myself was probably impossible.</p>

                                <summary>Just Ignore Him</summary> by Alan Davies
                                <p> Interesting look into the childhood of a comedian I admire. I discovered Alan Davies while watching cable TV in London and warming up to shows like QI and Taskmaster. Friend2 and I have particularly fond memories of getting
                                back to our flat at night--arms loaded with unfamiliar snacks from the grocery store down the street--and popping on the telly to wind down and absorb some culture. I somehow found out that Davies had a painful childhood
                                and, being always attracted to sad comedians because I somehow relate to their desperate need for everyone to like them, I decided to read his memoir. I remember it being very sad and sometimes amusing.</p>

                                <p> I don't remember finishing this book because I hated it so much. Just not my style, I guess. The author tried very hard to sound snarky and it wasn't landing for me.</p>

                                <p> Perfect, sweet, absolute gem of a book! I can't say enough how much I adored it. I literally wanted to become a witch when I read this and within days watched the movie.</p>

                                <p> Standard sad Steinbeck. But the imagery of the California countryside sticks with me, and the fact that I felt sorry for the main characters despite their flaws.</p>

                                <summary>Covered with Night</summary> by Nicole Eustace
                                <p> History is not my strong suit but this was a really interesting look at the problematic relations between colonists and Native Americans. Completely different justice systems, all kinds of bias, corruption, etc. Very eye-opening.
                                I didn't think I could hate colonialism more but here we are.</p>

                                <summary>A Christmas Carol</summary> by Charles Dickens
                                <p> Another surprise joy from what I expected to be a dusty old classic. I'd had a bad experience with Dickens after trying to read <em>Great Expectations</em> in high school with an English teacher who I despised. This was
                                a much more pleasant experience and proves why it is such a classic.</p>
